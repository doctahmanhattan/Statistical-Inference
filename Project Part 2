Part 2: Basic Inferential Data Analysis of ToothGrowth Data
Data Exploration and Summary:

We will use the ToothGrowth dataset available in the datasets package.

Code snippet
library(datasets)
data("ToothGrowth")

# Summary of the data
summary(ToothGrowth)
Use code with caution.

The summary provides basic statistics for each variable: mean, median, minimum, maximum, and quartiles. We can see there is some variation in tooth length (len) across different supplement types (supp) and dose levels (dose).

Exploratory Data Analysis:

A boxplot can be used to visualize the distribution of tooth length by supplement type.

Code snippet
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x = supp, y = len)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Tooth Length by Supplement", x = "Supplement", y = "Length (mm)")
Use code with caution.

The boxplot might reveal potential differences in median tooth length between the two supplement types (Vitamin C - VC and Orange Juice - OJ).

Comparing Tooth Growth by Supplement and Dose:

We can use t-tests to compare tooth growth between supplement types for each dose level and vice versa. It's important to check for normality and homoscedasticity of variances before applying t-tests.

Code snippet
# Check normality (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test)
shapiro.test(ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$supp == "VC"])
shapiro.test(ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ"])

# Check homoscedasticity (e.g., Bartlett test)
bartlett.test(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$supp)
Use code with caution.

Based on the normality and homoscedasticity tests, we can decide whether to proceed with parametric (t-tests) or non-parametric tests.

Here's a general approach for t-tests:

Code snippet
# Compare tooth growth by supplement for each dose level (assuming normality and homoscedasticity)
t.test(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$supp, subset = ToothGrowth$dose == 0.5)
t.test(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$supp, subset = ToothGrowth$dose == 1.0)
t.test(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$supp, subset = ToothGrowth$dose == 2.0)

# Compare tooth growth by dose level for each supplement type (assuming normality and homoscedasticity)
t.test(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$dose, subset = ToothGrowth$supp == "VC")
t.test(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$dose, subset = ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ")
Use code with caution.

Interpretation and Conclusions:

Interpret the p-values from the t-tests to draw conclusions about statistically significant differences in tooth growth between supplement types and dose levels. Consider the limitations of the chosen tests and the assumptions made (normality, homoscedasticity).

Future Considerations:

Depending on the results, further analysis might be needed, such as post-hoc tests to identify specific group differences or exploring alternative approaches if the assumptions for t-tests are not met.

Note: This response provides a general framework for analyzing the ToothGrowth data. The specific code and interpretations will depend on the results of the normality and homoscedasticity tests.
