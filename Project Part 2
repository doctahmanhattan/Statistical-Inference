Part 2: Basic Inferential Data Analysis of ToothGrowth Data
Data Exploration and Summary:

We will use the ToothGrowth dataset available in the datasets package.

Code snippet
library(datasets)
data("ToothGrowth")

# Summary of the data
summary(ToothGrowth)

The summary provides basic statistics for each variable: mean, median, minimum, maximum, and quartiles. We can see there is some variation in tooth length (len) across different supplement types (supp) and dose levels (dose).

Exploratory Data Analysis:

A boxplot can be used to visualize the distribution of tooth length by supplement type.

Code snippet
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x = supp, y = len)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Tooth Length by Supplement", x = "Supplement", y = "Length (mm)")


The boxplot might reveal potential differences in median tooth length between the two supplement types (Vitamin C - VC and Orange Juice - OJ).

Comparing Tooth Growth by Supplement and Dose:

Visual Inspection: We can create histograms or density plots for tooth length within each group (defined by supplement type and dose level) to get a sense of the distribution shape. Marked skewness or presence of outliers might suggest non-normality.
Code snippet
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x = len, color = supp)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~dose) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Tooth Length by Supplement and Dose", x = "Length (mm)", y = "Density")

This code creates a density plot with separate panels for each dose level. We can visually assess if the distributions within each group appear symmetrical and unimodal, suggesting normality.

QQ-Plots:  We can create quantile-quantile (QQ) plots for tooth length within each group. These plots compare the observed quantiles of the data to the expected quantiles of a normal distribution. A straight line suggests normality, while deviations indicate departures from normality.

QQ-Plots for Normality Assessment:

Code snippet
library(car)

# Example QQ-plot for VC supplement at 0.5mg dose
qqnorm(ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$supp == "VC" & ToothGrowth$dose == 0.5])
qqline(ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$supp == "VC" & ToothGrowth$dose == 0.5])

Repeat the above for other groups (supplements and doses). Significant deviations from the straight line might indicate non-normality.
Normality Tests: 

Anderson-Darling Test: This test might be more powerful for certain types of non-normality compared to Shapiro-Wilk.
D'Agostino-Pearson Test: This omnibus test combines skewness and kurtosis measures to assess normality.
Based on these explorations, we can decide whether to proceed with parametric (t-tests) or non-parametric tests for comparisons.
Alternative Normality Tests (Optional):

Code snippet
library(nortest)

# Example Anderson-Darling test for VC supplement at 0.5mg dose
ad.test(ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$supp == "VC" & ToothGrowth$dose == 0.5])

# Example D'Agostino-Pearson test for VC supplement at 0.5mg dose
ks.test(ToothGrowth$len[ToothGrowth$supp == "VC" & ToothGrowth$dose == 0.5], "normal")

Use the results of these tests alongside visual inspection and QQ-plots to reach a conclusion about normality for each group.

Choosing Statistical Tests:

Based on the normality assessment, you can decide on the appropriate statistical tests:

Parametric Tests (t-tests) if normality is assumed: Proceed with the t-tests mentioned earlier to compare tooth growth between supplement types and dose levels.
Non-parametric Tests (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) if normality is not assumed: Use the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare groups.
Here's a general approach for comparing groups:

Parametric Tests (if normality is assumed):

Code snippet
# t-tests for supplement type within each dose level
t.test(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$supp, subset = ToothGrowth$dose == 0.5)
t.test(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$supp, subset = ToothGrowth$dose == 1.0)
t.test(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$supp, subset = ToothGrowth$dose == 2.0)

# t-tests for dose level within each supplement type
t.test(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$dose, subset = ToothGrowth$supp == "VC")
t.test(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$dose, subset = ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ")

Non-parametric Tests (if normality is not assumed):

Code snippet
# Wilcoxon signed-rank test for supplement type within each dose level
wilcox.test(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$supp, paired = FALSE, subset = ToothGrowth$dose == 0.5)
wilcox.test(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$supp, paired = FALSE, subset = ToothGrowth$dose == 1.0)
wilcox.test(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$supp, paired = FALSE, subset = ToothGrowth$dose == 2.0)

# Wilcoxon signed-rank test for dose level within each supplement type
wilcox.test(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$dose, paired = FALSE, subset = ToothGrowth$supp == "VC")
wilcox.test(ToothGrowth$len ~ ToothGrowth$dose, paired = FALSE, subset = ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ")

Interpretation and Conclusions:

Interpret the p-values from the chosen tests (parametric or non-parametric) to draw conclusions about statistically significant differences in tooth growth between supplement types and dose levels. Consider the limitations of the chosen tests and the assumptions made (normality for parametric tests).

Future Considerations:

Depending on the results, further analysis might be needed, such as post-hoc tests to identify specific group differences or exploring transformations if non-normality persists and parametric tests are preferred. Consider post-hoc tests (e.g., Dunn's test) to identify specific group differences if non-parametric tests were used.
Explore data transformations (e.g., log transformation) if non-normality persists and parametric tests are preferred.
